- Use or click on a block with item
- Item entity burning
- Item entity inside a specific block (for instance water)
- Anvil crafting
- Falling block crushing items or block

## Dependency

Kiwi is an optional dependency to have some extra particles.

## Adding Recipes

To create a new recipe that works in every world you create, you will need a datapack loader mod, such as [OpenLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader).

Or you can add recipes using [CraftTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker) or KubeJS ([Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kubejs-forge) / [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kubejs-fabric)).
