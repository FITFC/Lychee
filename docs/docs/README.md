# Preface

Lychee is a mod allows you to define custom interactions using JSON recipes and datapack.

You can download Lychee on CurseForge:

- [Lychee (Forge)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lychee)
- ~~Lychee (Fabric)~~ (not ready yet)

Currently Lychee has support for following recipe type (with full JEI/REI support!):

- Use or click on a block with item
- Item entity burning
- Item entity inside a specific block (for instance water)
- Anvil crafting

## Adding recipes

To create a new recipe that works in every world you create, you will need a datapack loader mod, such as [OpenLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader).

Or you can add recipes using [CraftTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker) or [KubeJS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kubejs-forge).
